# odin-recipes

In this project i'm attempting to recreate a recipes site using only HTML.

I'm putting into practice some very basic concepts like elements and attributes as well as using git to save my work.
As you can see im using elements like "p, img, a, h1" which are the backbone of every html that I have seen so far. They provide a very useful way to structure the document.

This is the first of (I hope) many other sites i'm going to be making, with the mission of improving each day as a web developer.
